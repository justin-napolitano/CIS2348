# Behind the Scenes of My CIS2348 Python Projects

Hey there! I wanted to share a bit about the journey and the work behind my CIS2348 repository from Fall 2022. This collection of assignments and projects represents my exploration and growing mastery of Python programming fundamentals and problem-solving techniques.

## Motivation and Problem Solving

When I started this course, my goal was to build a solid foundation in programming concepts — everything from basic input/output and control structures to more advanced topics like sorting algorithms and object-oriented design. Each homework assignment was designed to challenge me to apply what I learned in practical ways.

For example, in HW1, I tackled simple user input and arithmetic operations, like calculating squares and cubes of numbers, or scaling recipes for lemonade. These small programs helped me get comfortable with Python syntax and logic.

Moving on to HW2 and HW3, I worked on more complex problems like parsing dates from text files, checking palindromes, and managing collections of objects representing items or teams. I even implemented sorting algorithms like selection sort and quicksort in HW4, which was a fantastic exercise in understanding algorithm efficiency and recursion.

The final project was particularly interesting because it involved reading and merging data from multiple CSV files — a real-world task that taught me about data handling, dictionaries, and the importance of clean, maintainable code.

## How It's Built

The entire repo is built using Python 3, which I chose for its readability and extensive standard library. Most scripts are standalone programs that prompt for user input, perform calculations or data processing, and print results.

Some highlights include:

- **File I/O and Regular Expressions:** In HW2, I parsed dates from text files using regex, then compared and formatted them using Python's `datetime` module.
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** In HW3, I created classes like `ItemToPurchase` and `Team` to encapsulate data and behavior, practicing principles like encapsulation and method design.
- **Algorithms:** HW4 challenged me to implement sorting algorithms from scratch, deepening my understanding of algorithmic thinking.
- **Data Integration:** The final project merges data from manufacturer, price, and service date CSV files, demonstrating how to combine datasets based on keys.

## Interesting Implementation Details

- In the quicksort implementation, I used the last element as the pivot and carefully managed indices to partition the list, which was a great way to grasp recursion and divide-and-conquer strategies.
- The lemonade recipe scaling in HW1 was a neat example of applying arithmetic operations to real-world problems, including unit conversions.
- Handling exceptions in user input (like age validation) showed me the importance of robust programs that can gracefully handle unexpected input.

## Why this project matters for my career

This collection of projects is more than just homework — it’s a tangible demonstration of my growth as a developer. It shows my ability to write clean, functional Python code, solve diverse problems, and handle data effectively. These skills are foundational for any software engineering role, especially those involving data processing or backend development.

Moreover, by sharing this work publicly, I’m building a portfolio that potential employers or collaborators can review. It reflects my commitment to learning and my readiness to tackle real-world coding challenges.

Thanks for reading! If you’re learning Python or diving into programming projects, I hope my experiences inspire you to keep coding and exploring.
