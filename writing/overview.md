Welcome to my CIS2348 repository. This collection houses a series of Python programming assignments and projects I completed during my CIS2348 course in Fall 2022. I built this to not only fulfill academic requirements but to also sharpen my programming skills. Let's break down what you can find here and why I think it's worth a look.

## What’s Inside the Repo

The CIS2348 repo is essentially a playground filled with programming tasks. Here's the scoop:

- **Homework Solutions (HW1 to HW4)**: These tackle fundamental topics such as:
  - Basic input/output
  - Control flow
  - Data structures
  - Sorting algorithms
  - File handling
  - Exception management
  
- **Final Project**: This lad focuses on CSV file processing, data merging, and integration. Think of it as a more intricate challenge where I put everything I learned into practice.

- **Object-Oriented Programming Examples**: By using classes and methods, I delved into the world of OOP, which is crucial for writing cleaner, reusable code.

## Why I Built This

Honestly, the motivation was pretty straightforward. I wanted a solid collection of work showcasing what I learned in my course. Each assignment taught me a new concept or reinforced a prior one. By compiling them here, I can revisit and reflect on my growth as a developer. Plus, this could be a useful resource for anyone taking a similar course or looking to pick up Python.

## Key Design Decisions

When setting this up, I made several key choices that shaped the final structure:

- **Modular Approach**: Each homework assignment and the final project exist in their own folders. This organization makes it easy for someone to navigate and find specific pieces of work.
  
- **Focus on Practicality**: I didn't just aim for correctness; I tried to implement best practices where possible. This includes input validation and error handling, especially in the final project.
  
- **Maintain Simplicity**: I opted for Python 3, keeping things as straightforward as possible. It’s widely used and great for beginners, which aligns with my primary goal: to learn and demonstrate.

## Tech Stack

This one’s easy: I used **Python 3** throughout. It's simple, powerful, and provides a wealth of libraries. That's all I really needed to get the job done effectively.

## How to Get Started

If you're keen on exploring the repo yourself, here's a quick rundown on how to kick things off:

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your machine. If not, get it sorted.

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/CIS2348.git
   cd CIS2348
   ```

### Running the Code

- Head to the folder of the homework you're interested in (e.g., `HW1`, `HW2`, etc.).
- Execute the Python scripts like this:
  ```bash
  python filename.py
  ```
- Don’t forget, some scripts demand specific input files (e.g., `inputDates.txt`, `ManufacturerList.csv`). Make sure those are in place.

## Project Structure

Here’s a glance at the way everything’s organized:

```
CIS2348/
├── FinalProjectPart1/       # Final project code involving CSV data processing
├── HW1/                    # Homework 1 assignments
├── HW2/                    # Homework 2 assignments
├── HW3/                    # Homework 3 assignments
├── HW4/                    # Homework 4 assignments
└── README.md               # This readme file
```

Each homework folder contains its own scripts tailored to specific problems, while the final project folder houses the more complex CSV processing code.

## Trade-offs Considered

In building out this repo, I had to make some important trade-offs:

- **Documentation vs. Speed**: While more comments and inline documentation would be beneficial, prioritizing the completion of assignments meant skimming on documentation. I now see that clearer comments would have made it a lot easier for someone else or even future me to understand the flow.

- **Features vs. Complexity**: I aimed to cover a broad range of topics without overcomplicating things. The final project could have benefited from additional features, but I wanted to balance ambition with a solid understanding of core principles first.

## What’s Next?

Looking forward, I see plenty of room for improvement:

- **Enhanced Documentation**: My first order of business involves adding detailed comments to all scripts. Clear documentation is key for future maintenance and readability.

- **Sample Inputs/Outputs**: Including input files and expected outputs would greatly simplify the testing process for anyone diving into the assignments.

- **Automated Testing**: I’m a huge advocate for automated testing, and I think I could implement this for homework assignments to ensure robustness.

- **Final Project Enhancements**: I’d like to expand the final project by improving data validation and error handling. Making it more resilient to bad data would elevate its quality.

## Stay Updated

Lastly, I tend to share updates and thoughts about my projects on social media. If you want to keep track of my progress or see what I'm up to next, find me on Mastodon, Bluesky, or Twitter/X. It’s always a good time to connect with fellow developers!

In summary, the CIS2348 repo is where I transformed theoretical knowledge into practical coding skills. It’s a reflection of my journey and a resource for anyone who might be walking a similar path. Enjoy exploring!
