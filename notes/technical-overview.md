This repository holds my Python assignments for the CIS2348 course from Fall 2022. It showcases essential programming concepts, problem-solving techniques, and algorithm implementations.

## Key Components

- **Homework Solutions**: Covers HW1 to HW4, including I/O, control flow, data structures, sorting, file handling, and exception management.
- **Final Project**: Processes CSV files, merges data, and integrates multiple sources.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Examples utilizing classes and methods.

## Getting Started

To run this code:

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/CIS2348.git
   cd CIS2348
   ```
2. Navigate to a specific homework folder (like `HW1`) and run:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```

**Gotchas**: Some scripts need input files (like `inputDates.txt`), so ensure those are in place.
